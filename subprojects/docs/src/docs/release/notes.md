## New and noteworthy

Here are the new features introduced in this Gradle release.

### Support version ranges in parent elements

Gradle now supports version ranges in parent elements of a POM, which was introduced by [Maven 3.2.2](https://maven.apache.org/docs/3.2.2/release-notes.html):

> Parent elements can now use bounded ranges in the version specification. You can now consistently use ranges for all intra-project dependencies, of which parents are a special case but still considered a dependency of projects that inherit from them. The following is now permissible:

```
<project>
  <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
  <parent>
    <groupId>org.apache</groupId>
    <artifactId>apache</artifactId>
    <version>[3.0,4.0)</version>
  </parent>
  <groupId>org.apache.maven.its.mng2199</groupId>
  <artifactId>valid</artifactId>
  <version>1</version>
  <packaging>pom</packaging>
</project>
```

IMPORTANT: if this is a patch release, ensure that a prominent link is included in the foreword to all releases of the same minor stream.

### Eclipse plugin separates output folders

The `eclipse` plugin now defines separate output directories for each source folder. This ensures that main and test classes are compiled to different directories. 

The plugin also records which Eclipse classpath entries are needed for running classes from each source folder through the new `gradle_scope` and `gradle_used_by_scope` attributes. Future [Buildship](http://eclipse.org/buildship) versions will use this information to provide a more accurate classpath when launching applications and tests.

### Parametrized tooling model builders.

The Tooling API now allows model builders to accept parameters from the tooling client. This is useful when there are multiple possible mappings from the Gradle project to the tooling model and the decision depends on some user-provided value.
Android Studio for instance will use this API to request just the dependencies for the variant that the user currently selected in the UI. This will greatly reduce synchronization times.

For more information see the [documentation](javadoc/org/gradle/tooling/provider/model/ParametrizedToolingModelBuilder.html) of the new API.

### Security upgrade of third-party dependencies

This version includes several upgrade of third-party dependency packages to fix the following security issues:

- [CVE-2017-7525](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-7525) (critical)
- SONATYPE-2017-0359 (critical)
- SONATYPE-2017-0355 (critical)
- SONATYPE-2017-0398 (critical)
- [CVE-2013-4002](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4002) (critical)
- [CVE-2016-2510](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2510) (severe)
- SONATYPE-2016-0397 (severe)
- [CVE-2009-2625](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-2625) (severe)
- SONATYPE-2017-0348 (severe)

This could avoid potential vulnerabilities.

### Visual Studio 2017 Support

It is now possible to compile native applications with the Visual C++ toolchain packaged with all versions of Visual Studio 2017.
  Note that discovery of a Visual Studio 2017 installation requires the [vswhere utility](https://github.com/Microsoft/vswhere).  Visual Studio 2017 versions earlier than update 2 do not install `vswhere` automatically, and so to use one of these earlier versions of Visual Studio 2017 when `vswhere` is not installed, you'll need to set [the installation directory on the VisualCpp toolchain](userguide/native_software.html#sec:defining_tool_chains).   

### C/C++ incremental build improvements

C/C++ compilation now takes the compiler version and system headers into account, making it safer to use those tasks with incremental build and [experimental native caching](userguide/build_cache.html#sec:task_output_caching_native_tasks).

### Embedded Ant version upgraded to Ant 1.9.9

Gradle now embeds [Ant 1.9.9](https://archive.apache.org/dist/ant/RELEASE-NOTES-1.9.9.html). Previous releases used Ant 1.9.6.

### Plugin repositories enhancements

Plugin repositories declared in a settings script can now have custom names:

```
// settings.gradle
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        maven {
            name = "My Custom Plugin Repository"
            url = "https://..."
        }
    }
}
```

Explicit notation for common repositories can now be used in settings scripts:

```
// settings.gradle
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        gradlePluginPortal()
        jcenter()
        google()
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
```

Plugin resolution now takes all plugin repositories into account and can resolve transitive plugin dependencies across them. Before that change, it was required that all transitive dependencies of a given plugin were present in the same repository as the plugin. It's not anymore. 

The Gradle Plugin Portal repository can now be added to build scripts. This is particularly useful for `buildSrc` or binary plugin builds:

```
// build.gradle
repositories {
    gradlePluginPortal()
}
```

### Use of canonical URL for `mavenCentral()` repository URL

In previous versions of Gradle the URL referred to by `RepositoryHandler.mavenCentral()` was pointing to `https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/`. Sonatype recommends using the canonical URL `https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/` instead. This version of Gradle makes the switch to `repo.maven.apache.org` when using the `mavenCentral()` API.

## Promoted features

Promoted features are features that were incubating in previous versions of Gradle but are now supported and subject to backwards compatibility.
See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the features that have been promoted in this Gradle release.

## Fixed issues

## Deprecations

Features that have become superseded or irrelevant due to the natural evolution of Gradle become *deprecated*, and scheduled to be removed
in the next major Gradle version (Gradle 5.0). See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the newly deprecated items in this Gradle release. If you have concerns about a deprecation, please raise it via the [Gradle Forums](https://discuss.gradle.org).

### Deprecation of no-rebuild command line options 

The command line options for avoiding a full rebuild of dependent projects in a multi-project builds (`-a`/`--no-rebuild`) were introduced in a very early version of Gradle. 
Since then Gradle optimized its up-to-date checking for project dependencies which renders the option obsolete. It has been deprecated and will be removed in Gradle 5.0.

## Potential breaking changes

### Change to the `Test` task structure

Common test framework functionality in the `Test` task moved to `AbstractTestTask`. Be aware that `AbstractTestTask` is the new base class for the `Test` task. The `AbstractTestTask` will be used by test frameworks outside of the JVM ecosystem. Plugins configuring an `AbstractTestTask` will find tasks for test frameworks (e.g., XCTest, Google Test, etc.).

### Changes in the `eclipse` plugin

The default output location in [EclipseClasspath](dsl/org.gradle.plugins.ide.eclipse.model.EclipseClasspath.html#org.gradle.plugins.ide.eclipse.model.EclipseClasspath:defaultOutputDir) changed from `${project.projectDir}/bin` to `${project.projectDir}/bin/default`.

### Removal of `@Incubating` methods

- `org.gradle.nativeplatform.tasks.InstallExecutable.setDestinationDir(Provider<? extends Directory>)` was removed.
    - Use `org.gradle.nativeplatform.tasks.InstallExecutable.getInstallDirectory()` instead.
- `org.gradle.nativeplatform.tasks.InstallExecutable.setExecutable(Provider<? extends RegularFile>)` was removed.
    - Use `org.gradle.nativeplatform.tasks.InstallExecutable.getSourceFile()` instead.

### Changes to Visual Studio toolchain discovery

In previous versions, Gradle would prefer a version of Visual Studio found on the path over versions discovered through any other 
means.  It will now consider a version found on the path only if a version is not found in the registry or through executing 
the [vswhere](https://github.com/Microsoft/vswhere) utility (i.e. it will consider the path only as a last resort).  In order to 
force a particular version of Visual Studio to be used, configure the [installation directory](dsl/org.gradle.nativeplatform.toolchain.VisualCpp.html#org.gradle.nativeplatform.toolchain.VisualCpp:installDir) on the Visual Studio toolchain.

### Ant version upgraded to Ant 1.9.9

Gradle has been upgraded to embed Ant 1.9.9 over Ant 1.9.6.

### Avoid checking other repositories when dependency resolution in one repository fails with HTTP status code in the 500 range

The HTTP status codes 5xx can be considered unrecoverable server states. Gradle will explicitly rethrow exceptions which occur in dependency resolution instead of quietly continue to the next repository similar to timeout issues introduced in Gradle 4.3.

### The type of `pluginManagement.repositories` changed

Before Gradle 4.4 it was a `PluginRepositoriesSpec`. This type has been removed and `pluginManagement.repositories` is now a regular `RepositoryHandler`.
